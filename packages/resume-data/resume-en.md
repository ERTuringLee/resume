### :banana: Tech Experience

#### [SmartAround Service](https://s.search.naver.com/p/around/search.naver)

The SmartAround is a service that provides users with necessary information based on their location. I participated in this project as a front-end engineer, and I was more concerned with UX than anything else. One of the most important aspects of the project was that it could be maintained without any problems even if the project maintainer changed. That's why I have written a code that is highly readable and document for supplying it. To overcome these problems, TypeScript was adopted in this proejct. Although there was some difficulty, it was applied successfully, and all developers participating in the project were satisfied with TypeScript.

Since it was a project that I participated in from the initial design, it was an opportunity to consider the project's architecture. Also, because we had to expose a lot of information at the same time on a small mobile screen, there were many performance considerations. Animation also took a lot of time to give the user a smooth and natural animation.

#### Development Environment scaffolding tool

I developed a scaffolding tool as one of the means to improve development productivity. This project is based on the Yeoman Generator and scaffolds development projects based on the templates that are used in the team. As I proceeded through this project, I had an opportunity to deeply understand the webpack and the complex development environment that constituted the recent front-end.

Considering a more efficient development environment, I have developed additional webpack plugin and CLI tools. I spent a great deal of effort to improve my productivity by making it a tool of repetitive tasks.

### :eggplant: Presentation

#### [GDG Campus 2018.02 Meetup (Korean) - Developers who want to work together](https://speakerdeck.com/jaeyeophan/gdg-campus-2018-meetup-balpyojaryo-hamgge-ilhago-sipeun-gaebalja)

Introduce "development" that I learned in the field. I define 'coding' to be narrower and share what I felt that 'coding is only part of the process of developing something.' If possible, I will talk about the direction to move towards 'the developer we want to work with' based on this content.
